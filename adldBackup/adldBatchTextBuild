Other Entry Pathways Additional Entry Requirements VET BIOSCIENCE Places available: Commonwealth-supported places (CSP) are the only places available to applicants commencing as domestic students. Commonwealth-supported places are obtained via a competitive process through several different entry pathways, and selection is currently based on past academic performance. In practice, 40 Commonwealth supported places in the first year of the program are likely to be taken on the basis of an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) earned at completion of secondary education, a Grade Point Average (GPA) earned during university-level studies in a program un-related to Veterinary Bioscience or Animal Science, or a result in the Special Tertiary Admissions Test (STAT). Approximately fifteen Commonwealth-supported places in the second year of the program are likely to be taken on the basis of a Grade Point Average (GPA) earned during university-level studies in a Bachelor of Science (Animal Science) or a related program. However, there may be adjustments within the overall quota of 55 to ensure that the past academic performance of applicants through the different entry pathways meets the same threshold.

Special Entry applicants You must be 18 years or over before February 1st of the year that you will be studying. If you have studied a higher education program within the last two years, you must not have studied more than 2 years full-time equivalent in that program and you must not hold a completed higher education level award. If you meet this criteria, you will be ranked according to your result in the Special Tertiary Admissions Test (STAT). Personal Competencies (PC) and Employment Experience (EE) statements may also contribute to your rank. If you submit a PC or EE statement, and one of these ranks higher than your STAT score, then the highest ranking statement will contribute 50% to your overall rank and the STAT will contribute the remaining 50%. If you do not submit a PC or EE statement, or if the statements have a lower rank than the STAT, then you will compete for a place on the basis of your STAT result only.

A Grade Point Average (GPA) is calculated for each separate program you have undertaken (apart from some double degree programs where the GPA is combined). You compete on the basis of your best GPA. VET applicants You must have completed an AQF Certificate IV or above from a Registered Training Organisation. Your application will be ranked according to the level of the award. Special Entry applicants You must be 18 years or over before February 1st of the year that you will be studying. If you have studied a higher education program within the last two years, you must not have studied more than 2 years full-time equivalent in that program and you must not hold a completed higher education level award. If you meet this criteria, you will be ranked according to your result in the Special Tertiary Admissions Test (STAT). Personal Competencies (PC) and Employment Experience (EE) statements may also contribute to your rank. If you submit a PC or EE statement, and one of these ranks higher than your STAT score, then the highest ranking statement will contribute 50% to your overall rank and the STAT will contribute the remaining 50%. If you do not submit a PC or EE statement, or if the statements have a lower rank than the STAT, then you will compete for a place on the basis of your STAT result only. Indigenous applicants may be eligible for entry through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Access Scheme. See Wilto Yerlo for further information. Without formal qualifications? You may be eligible for our special access schemes. Other Entry Pathways
