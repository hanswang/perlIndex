Other Entry Pathways Additional Entry Requirements VET BIOSCIENCE Places available: Commonwealth-supported places (CSP) are the only places available to applicants commencing as domestic students. Commonwealth-supported places are obtained via a competitive process through several different entry pathways, and selection is currently based on past academic performance. In practice, 40 Commonwealth supported places in the first year of the program are likely to be taken on the basis of an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) earned at completion of secondary education, a Grade Point Average (GPA) earned during university-level studies in a program un-related to Veterinary Bioscience or Animal Science, or a result in the Special Tertiary Admissions Test (STAT). Approximately fifteen Commonwealth-supported places in the second year of the program are likely to be taken on the basis of a Grade Point Average (GPA) earned during university-level studies in a Bachelor of Science (Animal Science) or a related program. However, there may be adjustments within the overall quota of 55 to ensure that the past academic performance of applicants through the different entry pathways meets the same threshold.
