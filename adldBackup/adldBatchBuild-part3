 hahahah 
<div>all applicants must attend and pass an audition/interview and an aural/theory test (except Musicology applicants, who will be required to sit the aural/theory test only). Selections for music programs are made on the basis of audition/interview scores combined with academic achievement and the aural/theory test score. It is possible to audition for more than one instrument or area of specialisation if you have multiple interests and could pursue studies in any one of them. Separate audition application forms are required for each specialisation.
<p>The main round of auditions/interviews will be held in the week beginning 30 September 2013.The online and downloadable audition/interview application form and full details are available on the web at <a href="http://www.music.adelaide.edu.au/">www.music.adelaide.edu.au</a>. Application forms for the main round must be returned to the Elder Conservatorium of Music by Friday 30 August 2013. Late applications cannot be accepted.
</p><p>For those unable to attend the main round, a small number of auditions/interviews will be held in a late round commencing on 2 December 2013. Applications for this will close on Friday 1 November 2013. Applicants will usually need to provide a separate written explanation about their need for a late audition/interview. While a further round of auditions/interviews may be held in February 2014\, these will not include all instruments/specialisations. Any Jazz instrumental auditions are highly unlikely to be available.
</p><p>The Conservatorium offers auditions/interviews in selected interstate centres, particularly Melbourne and Sydney. Please check the web or phone 08 8313 5995 for further information.</p></div>

Other Entry Pathways Additional Entry Requirements all applicants must attend and pass an audition/interview and an aural/theory test (except Musicology applicants, who will be required to sit the aural/theory test only). Selections for music programs are made on the basis of audition/interview scores combined with academic achievement and the aural/theory test score. It is possible to audition for more than one instrument or area of specialisation if you have multiple interests and could pursue studies in any one of them. Separate audition application forms are required for each specialisation. The main round of auditions/interviews will be held in the week beginning 30 September 2013.The online and downloadable audition/interview application form and full details are available on the web at www.music.adelaide.edu.au. Application forms for the main round must be returned to the Elder Conservatorium of Music by Friday 30 August 2013. Late applications cannot be accepted. For those unable to attend the main round, a small number of auditions/interviews will be held in a late round commencing on 2 December 2013. Applications for this will close on Friday 1 November 2013. Applicants will usually need to provide a separate written explanation about their need for a late audition/interview. While a further round of auditions/interviews may be held in February 2014\, these will not include all instruments/specialisations. Any Jazz instrumental auditions are highly unlikely to be available. The Conservatorium offers auditions/interviews in selected interstate centres, particularly Melbourne and Sydney. Please check the web or phone 08 8313 5995 for further information.
