<   <p>Prosthetics and orthotics are clinical disciplines that deal with artificial limbs (prostheses) for people with amputations and supportive devices (orthoses) for people with musculoskeletal weakness or neurological disorders. You will study anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, prosthetic and orthotic prescription, and design and fabrication. You will also develop strong practical skills in research methodology, clinical assessment and the application of prosthetic and orthotic techniques. Clinical placements are an important part of our program.<br /></p>
---
>   <p>Our National Centre for Prosthetics and Orthotics offers the only course of this type in Australia. It is highly regarded internationally and accredited as a Category 1 course by the International Society of Prosthetics and Orthotics. Our postgraduate coursework program is for students with a relevant first degree and offers you a professional qualification in prosthetics and orthotics. Prosthetist-orthotists are integral members of healthcare teams with a clinical, technical, advisory and educational role.</p>
