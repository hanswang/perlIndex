174c160
<   <p>Mathematics may be studied as a major in the Bachelor of Science and many related double degrees or&nbsp;as part of&nbsp;computing, nanotechnology and engineering courses.</p>
---
>   <p>Our program caters for graduates wanting advanced training and for graduates of other disciplines who wish to update their skills or retrain in computer science, mathematics or statistics. Masterâ€™s-level training is available in statistical modelling of physical, biological and economic phenomena. Data analysis using computer-related technology is emphasised.</p>
176,178c162
<   <p>Studying statistics can help you prepare for a career in science and health science disciplines, such as environmental science, genetics, biology and many more.<br /></p>
< 
<   <p>Our statistics program was the first to obtain accreditation from the <a href="http://www.statsoc.org.au/">Statistical Society of Australia Inc</a> (SSAI), and is currently the only accredited undergraduate program in Victoria. Upon graduation, you are eligible for Graduate Statistician status upon joining the SSAI.<br /></p>

< <p>The current shortage of graduates at the national and international level means graduates are highly sought after in the roles of medical statistician, financial analyst, applied mathematician, meteorologist, mathematics teacher and sports statistician.<br /></p>
< 
< <p>Become a mathematics teacher by combining the required minimum of mathematics in a Bachelor of Science degree with a Diploma of Education, or by doing a major in mathematics in the Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Science Education double degree.</p>
---
> <p>There is a worldwide shortage of qualified statisticians. Graduates are prepared for a range of careers that require quantitative skills. Mathematics and statistics play a crucial role in many areas of science including computer science and the life sciences.<br /></p>
