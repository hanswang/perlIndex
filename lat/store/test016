<   <p>Occupational therapy is about people's occupational needs and the loss of daily living skills that follow physical, emotional, psychological and social disorders. Occupational therapists help people to become more independent and improve their productivity, well-being and quality of life. You will develop knowledge and skills in assessment and treatment, the therapeutic use of occupations, intervention techniques, the design of equipment and adaptation of environments. Our course is accredited by Occupational Therapy Australia and the World Federation of Occupational Therapists.</p>
