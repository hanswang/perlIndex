< <h2>Why study a civil engineering course?</h2>
< 
< <p>Civil engineers should be creative, curious, analytical and detail-orientated. Graduates trained in civil engineering can specialise in construction, environmental and transport engineering, or managing people and projects.</p>
< 
< <p>Our Bachelor of Civil Engineering prepares you to work in the design, construction and maintenance of almost all basic types of contemporary infrastructure, including bridges, multi-storey buildings, highways, railways, tunnels, airports, water supply and waste collection systems.</p>

< <p>There is currently a shortage of civil engineers in Australia. You&#8217;re likely to find work in a variety of public and private organisations within Australia and overseas.</p>
< 
< <p>La Trobe graduates work on diverse projects all over the world, such as large-scale structural projects and oil rigs, with mining companies, water authorities and local government.<br /></p>
< 
< <p>Upon completion of your civil engineering course, you will be eligible for membership of <a href="http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au">Engineers Australia</a>, and other professional bodies depending on your specialisation.</p>
---
> <p>The need for civil engineers is increasing due to the demand for sustainable infrastructure and consideration of environmental issues in future developments. In Australia, sustainability and environmental issues are particularly relevant to the water and local government sectors. Similar career opportunities also exist overseas. Graduates may work on large-scale structural projects and oil rigs, and with mining companies, water authorities, local governments and the private sector.</p>
