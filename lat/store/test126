< 
<   <p>Aboriginal studies will help you develop an appreciation of Indigenous Australia by studying contemporary Indigenous identity, the development of Indigenous societies, Indigenous people&#39;s relationship to Western law, and the process of reconciliation. To do this, you can take subjects from anthropology, archaeology, behavioural health sciences, English, genetics and human variation, history, legal studies, linguistics, religious studies, and sociology.</p>
