< <h3>Sport Management placement opportunities</h3>
< 
< <p>As part of our commitment to innovating curriculum design and development, we have recently appointed several Work Integrated Learning Coordinators at our Melbourne and Regional campuses. Work integrated learning means you&#39;ll get to apply your skills in the workplace, as you study. You can earn credit towards your degree through work placements or simulations. Work integrated learning is endorsed by the Federal Government and industry groups such as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It will assist to increase your employability potential when you graduate.</p>
< 
< <p>Additionally, placements are offered in various Sport Management subjects.&nbsp;The Sports Practicum gives you the chance to analyse current practices, evaluate personal and professional competencies and apply theory to a sports management issue. In the Victorian Champions League, you become the Club Manager within Football Federation Victoria and develop your sport management skills to develop and promote the League. The Sport Management Project lets you apply theory to a practical project negotiated with your unit coordinator.</p>
