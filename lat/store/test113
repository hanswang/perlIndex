159,165c159
<   <p><a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/education/outdoors">Outdoor education</a> is the study of relationships humans have with nature through outdoor experiences. You will experience how knowledge is shaped by environments and how the environment in turn is shaped by our thoughts and practices.&nbsp; You will study concepts drawn from psychology, education, eco-psychology, environmental ethics and eco-philosophy.</p>
< 
<   <p>From 2013 the areas of specialisation Outdoor Environmental Education, Nature Tourism and Natural Resources Education are offered as majors within the Outdoor Education and Outdoor Recreation Courses rather than as independent courses.<br /></p>
< 
<   <p>The five majors offered across the two courses give you choice in subjects, specialisations and outcomes. With the exception of Physical and Outdoor Education, the first year of each course is similar allowing you to apply to transfer at the end of first year when, after a year of study and experience in the unit, you are better equipped to decide which is the right course and major for you.</p>
< 
<   <p>Be part of the close knit student and staff community at the largest dedicated provider of outdoor and environmental education in the world.</p>
---
>   <p>The Outdoor and Environmental Education unit in Bendigo has an international reputation and is the largest dedicated provider of outdoor and environmental education in the world. Graduates with limited experience in outdoor or environmental education study our intensive graduate certificate program that allows you to choose subjects that you need. If you have demonstrated expertise in outdoor or environmental education, our Masters program allows you to develop expertise in a new area or add depth to a specialist area.</p>
