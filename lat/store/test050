<   <p>Our degrees give you a solid grounding in economic theory and history while developing skills in quantitative analysis and logical thought. You will graduate with a confident grasp of the tools necessary to analyse and solve business problems in the workplace. Develop skills in economic modelling, quantitative methods and statistics and apply economics to policy issues and real-world problems. Train in microeconomics (the study of households, firms and market) and macroeconomics (the study of growth, unemployment and inflation). Choose a specialisation in business economics, macroeconomic or microeconomic analysis and policy, business models and forecasting, international trade and finance, and resource and environmental economics.<br /></p>
---
>   <p>We provide a range of highly-sought-after skills to analyse, understand and solve a wide range of everyday business and public policy problems. We offer postgraduate degrees for economics graduates to progress to an advanced level, as well as non-economics graduates who want a solid grounding in the discipline. Study the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services. Learn about key issues that affect the economy: interest rates, taxation, labour relations, gross national product, inflation, unemployment and economic growth.<br /></p>
