< 
< <p>If you care about the neighbourhood you live in; the time it takes to get to work; or just the fact that water from your tap is drinkable &#8211; if you care about any of those things, then you care about planning. Planning is the opportunity to change the way we live for the better, by studying our, local environments, cities, geography and community priorities.</p>

173c183
< <p>Australia is currently experiencing a shortage of qualified planners, and graduates enjoy excellent starting salaries and work prospects.</p>
---
>   <p>Our courses place an emphasis on understanding contemporary issues such as facilitating change, sustainable development, climate change, indigenous communities and water management within the context of a changing society in both urban and rural areas.</p>
175,179c185,186
< <p>Planners combine their knowledge of planning practice and theory with a fundamental understanding of a range of subjects to help develop better ways to live in cities and regional areas. Graduates work in local and state government, private firms, research organisations and regional authorities and must develop strong communication and analytical skills to thrive in their careers.</p>
< 
< <h2>Planning Excellence 2012 Victorian Awards<br /></h2>
< 
< <p>The Community Planning and Development Program picked up the award for 'Cutting Edge Teaching and Research' based on our extensive fieldwork and international study tour program at the Planning Institute of Australia (Victorian Division) Annual Awards Ceremony, 2012.</p>
---
>   <p>We give strong recognition to the growing importance of understanding and working with communities, of community development agendas and of the need to achieve social, economic and environmental improvements with a focus on supporting and facilitating sustainable development for liveable communities in rural and regional areas in Australia and overseas with a particular emphasis on the countries of South and South East Asia.</p>
