< <h3>Ecology placements</h3>
< 
< <p>Students participate in <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/environmental-management-and-ecology/your-study-experience/field-trips">field trips</a> in second and third year. These include the Murray River floodplain, the Australian Alps, Mount Hotham, Falls Creek, the South Australian desert and Western Plains Zoo. You will do research in areas that are environmentally sensitive and have relevant management issues. There is a compulsory work placement in third year where you participate in management and research activities of your host organisation.<br /></p>
< 
< <p>You can also gain an understanding of industry career paths and the specialisations available by undertaking an <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/scitecheng/study/industry-based-learning-and-cadetships">industry cadetship</a>. Cadetships&nbsp; usually take place during the summer and winter study breaks, but some longer placements are available for one or two semesters.<a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/scitecheng/study/industry-based-learning-and-cadetships"></a><br /></p>
