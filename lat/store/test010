174c171
<   <p>Zoology is the study of animals and their ecology, behaviour, structure, physiology, development, origin, and distributions. Study individual animals down to the molecular level, as well as their populations and&nbsp;communities and the ways they interact with plants and the physical environment.</p>
---
>   <p>Our flexible Postgraduate Diploma in Science allows you to develop advanced knowledge and skills in zoology by completing a research project and thesis under supervision of a zoology academic. Key research skills of oral and written presentation are developed through a coursework program of training and assessment.</p>
176c173
<   <p>Join our field courses to the Victorian Mallee or Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reed. You will have access to <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/wildlife">La Trobe's Wildlife Sanctuary</a> - 30ha of bushland on the Melbourne campus, in which you will gain first-hand experience in ecological techniques.</p>
