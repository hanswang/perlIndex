< <p>Clinical placements help you to put your theoretical learning into clinical practice and develop the skills to work as an independent practitioner. Clinical education and professional practice is done in the last 18 months of your course largely within the Orthoptics Clinical School Network. The Orthoptics Clinical School Network consists of health services operating ophthalmology and orthoptic clinical programs. These include private ophthalmology clinics in metropolitan Melbourne as well as the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, the Royal Children's Hospital, Northern Health, Alfred Hospital, Austin Health and Monash Medical Centre. We also have strong networks with clinical placement providers in regional Victoria, interstate and overseas. Students, for iinstance, have done placements in Albury, Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, Warrnambool, Adelaide, Alice Springs, Brisbane, Gold Coast, Cairns, Canberra, Hobart, Perth, Rockhampton and Townsville.</p>
< 
< <p>You must undertake at least one placement outside of metropolitan Melbourne in the final year. Placements happen throughout the year and are not limited to standard semester weeks. You will be required to wear a standard uniform whilst on professional placement.<br /></p>
