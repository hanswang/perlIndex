< <h3>Tourism and Hospitality Management placement opportunities</h3>
< 
< <p>As part of our commitment to innovating curriculum design and development, we have recently appointed several Work Integrated Learning Coordinators at our Melbourne and Regional campuses.</p>

Work integrated learning is endorsed by the Federal Government and industry groups such as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It will assist to increase your employability potential when you graduate.</p>
< 
< <p>You will also gain work experience in food and beverage service, accommodation operations, hospitality management, staging special events or tourism ventures. Our partnership with the RACV Club includes student placements and paid internships.</p>
< 
< <p>In some placements, you can earn certificates in Responsible Service of Alcohol, Responsible Service of Food, Micros Opera (widely used accommodation booking software) and Galileo (global reservations and ticketing system software).</p>
