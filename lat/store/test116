<   <p>Nanotechnology is the science of the very small -&nbsp;working on a scale of nanometres, a&nbsp;millionth of a millimetre. New products and processes are developed where physics, chemistry, biology and engineering meet. Nanotechnology applications include computer technology, healthcare, sustainability and helping to make vehicles and machines faster, lighter and stronger.</p>
---
>   <p>Our program features lectures, seminars by leading practitioners and practical experience. Develop the skills needed to excel in the rapidly developing field of nanotechnology. Understand, create and control events on the scale of nanometres. The course has a strong research focus and top students work in the state-of-the-art research laboratories equipped with world-class fabrication and analytical technology.</p>
170c170,172
<   <p>We offer an undergraduate program and a combined Bachelor and Master’s course. Top students can blend a Master’s qualification in nanotechnology with an honours-level science program.</p>
---
>   <p>Students have access to some of the best teaching and research facilities in the world with the construction of a new $94 million <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/lims">La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science (LIMS)</a> building. LIMS focuses on training researchers to turn molecular science, biotechnology and nanotechnology research into medical solutions.</p>
> 
>   <p>Graduates may be eligible for membership of the <a href="http://www.aip.org.au/info/">Australian Institute of Physics</a> (AIP).</p>
180,184c182
< <p>Our graduates have been placed and employed in businesses such as SGS, Rio Tinto, Dulux, Starpharma, Air Services Australia, Crocodile Gold Corp., Australian Radiation Services, CETEC-Foray and the Australian Academy of Technological Science and Engineering.</p>
< 
< <p>You can find work in roles such as physicist, chemist, space physicist or research scientist.<br /></p>
