< <p>Studying botany at La Trobe allows you to participate in some of Australia's most important and exciting areas of research. The study of plants and related organisms is an important science associated with environmental issues, the development of disease-resistant food and the management of our forest resources.</p>
---
>   <p>We offer a flexible program to take your botanical knowledge and skills to an advanced level. You may be located within the department at our Melbourne (Bundoora) campus or do your experimental work at other institutions that include Victorian AgriBiosciences Centre (VABC), the Department of Primary Industries (DPI) or the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre. Students will soon access some of the best teaching and research facilities in the world.&nbsp; <a href="./?a=216114">AgriBio, the Centre of AgriBioscience</a>, is under construction and will be one of Australiaâ€™s premier research facilities. AgriBio will support the agricultural sector through improved productivity, better disease protection and reduced environmental impact.</p>
170,172c171,172
< <p>Study plant ecology, plant pathology, mycology, the ecological physiology of plants, plant biochemistry, plant molecular biology, genetic engineering of plants, and the taxonomy, evolution and biogeography of flowering plants. You can undertake botanical work in places such as Mt Hotham and the Otways by enrolling in one of our field trips.</p>
< 
< <p>Choose subjects from other biological sciences (biochemistry, genetics, microbiology and zoology) to gain a firm foundation in botany that is also tailored to your other interests.</p>

< <p>This course will offer&nbsp;broad&nbsp;skills including project design, data collection, data analysis and the preparation of reports. &nbsp;Graduates are therefore prepared for careers such as research scientists, biotechnologists or conservationists in places such as government organisations, parks and wildlife management, conservation, medical science, horticulture and agriculture.<br /></p>
---
> <p>Graduates are prepared for careers in government and business locally and abroad. You may also advance to higher-level research degrees in your area of interest.</p>
