<   <p>Dietitians apply the art and science of human nutrition to help people understand the relationship between food and health. They have a key role in the management of diseases and conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, gastrointestinal disorders, obesity, malnutrition, food allergy and intolerance. Dietitians also work toward the prevention of many diseases and conditions through nutrition education, health promotion and advocacy. You will gain practical experience in clinical and other dietetic environments and study chemistry, human biosciences, public health, research, food science, nutrition and dietetics.<br /></p>
