< <p>As part of our commitment to innovating curriculum design and development, we have recently appointed several Work Integrated Learning Coordinators at our Melbourne and Regional campuses. Work integrated learning means you'll get to apply your skills in the workplace, as you study. You can earn credit towards your degree through work placements or simulations. Work integrated learning is endorsed by the Federal Government and industry groups such as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It will assist to increase your employability potential when you graduate.</p>

> <p>We are home to one of Australia’s largest wholly university-owned and managed technology parks. Companies in the research and development park conduct business in various areas including business intelligence, healthcare, software development and mining. Students with good results can take part in an industry internship of up to 12 weeks. Placements may be in Australia, Singapore, India, Malaysia or Dubai. This can be done part-time during study, full-time in summer semester, or after you finish your course. Students planning to do an internship after they have completed their course will not be eligible for a student visa.</p>
