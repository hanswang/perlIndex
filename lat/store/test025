< 
<   <p>Social media and the internet have revolutionised the quantities of information generated and shared around the world – but have also heightened the demand for high quality information. Journalism and professional communication courses offer a wealth of career opportunities, from reporting roles with traditional media, to production roles in new media, to public relations and communication roles in organisations across the community.</p>
< 
<   <p>La Trobe's journalism courses offer a thorough grounding in the past and current roles of media as well as the practical aspects of content development – with a strong emphasis on industry experience. Each program offers opportunities for internships and work placements, as well as education and tuition to equip graduates with the skills required for a media career.</p>
< 
<   <p>Study the social, political, economic and cultural role of the media. Learn about print, broadcast and online journalism and digital media. Develop skills in research, writing, editing and production.</p>
< 
<   <p>If you are interested in studying journalism, we've prepared a list of <a href="http://latrobe.custhelp.com/app/answers/list/kw/HUSSABJ/">frequently asked questions</a> that both current and prospective students have about&nbsp;journalism at La Trobe.</p>
