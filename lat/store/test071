< <p>Sustainability and global warming are significant contemporary issues. You can specialise in sustainability in energy production while studying electronic engineering or civil engineering<br /></p>
< 
< <p>In electronic engineering, you will study zero-emissions power generation technologies and conversion technologies such as inverters for DC to AC, transmission line and other communications technologies for the renewable energy industry in Australia.<br /></p>
< 
< <p>In our civil engineering course, you will study climate, sustainability and society; environmental law; civil construction and environment; environmental case studies; and sustainable infrastructure. Understand the role of engineering technologists in the community and develop an awareness of the social and environmental effects of your decisions.</p>
---
>   <p>There is a worldwide need for sustainable infrastructure to ensure future prosperity, but also a critical shortage of skilled professionals for these projects. Our electronic engineering&nbsp; coursework program enhances the&nbsp; knowledge of graduates and integrates learning with industry-based work experience and project opportunities. Study electronic engineering, and specialise in biomedical, communication, electronic systems or optical engineering.</p>
> </div>
169,171c167
< <p>Our electronic engineering students are prepared for work in manufacturing, research and development, maintenance, quality control, medical related industries, space and physics related industries and consumer goods companies.</p>
< 
< <p>Our civil engineering students are prepared for work in private industry, consultancies, local, state, and federal government organisations, and in research. Career paths range from general engineering practice and management roles up to CEO level.<br /></p>
---
> <p>The need for engineers is increasing due to the demand for sustainable infrastructure and consideration of environmental issues in future developments. Graduates may work on large-scale projects and oil rigs, and with mining companies, water authorities, local governments and the private sector locally and overseas.</p>
