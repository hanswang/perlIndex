We can see and feel the changes it brings. China and India's economies boom, Indonesia becomes the world's largest host of Facebook users, people across the globe go crazy for Korean K-Pop and the US looks to secure its strategic position in the Pacific. Â  The Asian Century presents opportunities and challenges across industry and this degree will give you the knowledge and skills you need to capitalise on and respond to these changes. Â  This unique and highly-regarded degree will provide you with the Asian language skills and contextual knowledge necessary to work in Asia and help lead Australia's engagement with the region. Â  You will develop language skills in at least one Asian language and an understanding of the cultural, political, economic and environmental issues facing the region. Â  Your linguistic fluency and cultural understanding will be honed through opportunities to spend time in the region as part of your study. Opportunities range from intensive in-country courses to our flagship Year in Asia cultural immersion program. Â  Career Options Employment Opportunities As Australia moves toward increased educational, trade, business, legal and cultural interaction with Asia, the demand for people with Asia-Pacific language training and knowledge of the area is increasing. Career prospects for Asia-Pacific Studies graduates in both the public and private sectors are good. Asian Studies graduates find employment in marketing, international trade, banking and finance, teaching, tourism, as well as all areas of federal,state and overseas government departments with policy and operational interests in Asia and the Pacific. Graduates who have combined their studies of Asia and the Pacific with vocationally oriented qualifications in, say, economics, international relations, political science or law, are especially well placed to find employment in Australia and overseas, and are well placed to benefit from career opportunities which are opening up as Australia's relations with the nations of Asia and the Pacific continue to develop. Asia-Pacific language graduates obtain employment as translators and interpreters. There is a need for personnel who can communicate with non-English speakers, specifically in government departments dealing with immigration and ethnic affairs, foreign affairs, customs and excise, social welfare, health and consumer affairs. Further, a number of foreign language newspapers and radio programs employ translators. Asia-Pacific language graduates who complete a postgraduate Diploma of Education can teach languages in primary and secondary schools. Asia-Pacific Studies graduates are also employable in areas not directly related to their language and area studies because the training they obtain develops the ability to carry out research, communicate ideas and suggest solutions to problems. Employers value their high level of intellectual training. Learning Outcomes Upon completion of a Bachelor of Asia-Pacific Studies, graduates will be able to:Â  Demonstrate the ability to communicate in one of the languages of the region (graduates' language ability will vary, depending on their level of graduation).Â  Evaluate the Â theories, factual content and research approaches relevant to one of the countries, sub-regions or thematic issues within the Asia-Pacific region.Â  Identify relevant regional and international literature relevant to one of the countries, sub-regions or thematic issues within the Asia-Pacific region.Â  Determine the processes through which current knowledge about the Asia-Pacific region has been developed.Â  Admission Requirements Admission to all programs is on a competitive basis. Admission to undergraduate degrees is based on meeting the ATAR requirement or equivalent as outlined below: â€¢ An Australian year 12 qualification or international equivalent; OR â€¢ A completed Associate Diploma, Associate Degree, AQF Diploma, Diploma, AQF Advanced Diploma or Graduate Certificate; OR â€¢ At least one standard full-time year (1.0 FTE) in a single program of degree level study at an Australian higher education institution; OR â€¢ An approved tertiary preparation course unless subsequent study is undertaken.

How can the cost of the coffee beans make up only a few cents of the price of a cup of coffee? With the world' highest minimum wage rate, can Australia ever compete with low wage countries? The ANU Bachelor of Economics provides a framework and a way of thinking to help answer questions like these. Your coursework will span economics (both theory and applied), economic history, and econometrics while developing your analytical problem-solving and quantitative skills. Whether working as an economist or in some other role, your Bachelor of Economics degree and training will be sought after. Career Options Employment Opportunities Economics provides a foundation for careers in: Public policy International development Â Business and management Government and politicsÂ  Law Finance and insurance Teaching and education Marketing and tourismÂ  Examples of job titles in economics are listed below. Government Departments Australian and overseas governments provide many career paths for economists.Â  Departments like Finance, Treasury, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Productivity Commission and the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics recruit heavily from the ANU.Â  Economists are also much in demand in other government departments dealing with issues such as Trade, Education, Employment and Social Security.Â Â  Business and Management Firms recruit economists because their advice is vital to businesses in understanding their business environment, how competitors react, and how changes in things such as interest rates, oil prices, exchange rates and consumer demand are likely to affect the business.Â  Consultancy and accounting firms employ economists to advise their clients which include both private firms and governments. International Agencies International agencies such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and Oxfam recruit economists to advise them on the effects of policy changes, financial crises and conflicts in one part of the global economy on another, as they are transmitted through trade and financial flows.Â  Economists advise on trade policy and macroeconomic policy coordination. Resource and Environmental Economist Economists are employed to study natural resource use and environmental problems and their relationship to economic behaviour.Â  Employers include mining firms and regulatory agencies.Â  Economists contribute to the better management of natural resources and improving the global environment.

IELTS(A):overall 6.5(each>=6)/TOEFL(paper-based): 570(TWE 4.5);TOEFL(internet-based): 80(S 18+L 18+W 20+R 20); CAE: 80; PTE Academic: 64(55 each);	Philosophy (Honours)	Philosophy (Honours)/ Science	Are you looking for a degree to challenge and inspire you? Are you excited by the opportunity to undertake a research-focussed degree? The Bachelor of Philosophy (Honours) or PhB is a unique program that allows intellectually ambitious students to explore their interests, develop their research skills and be mentored by leading academics, while enjoying the camaraderie of a group of like-minded and social students. The PhB degree has been offered in Science since 2003. The PhB degree is now rolling out for offer across a broader range of disciplines and in 2014 this degree will allow you to focus either on science or on Asia and Pacific studies - an exciting new development for high achieving students. Regardless of your main focus, there is still room for you to explore other disciplines. The four year PhB program is designed with flexibility in mind - each PhB program is as individual as the student taking it. Each year, you will work with your mentor to tailor a program you will find stimulating and challenging, including courses from other Colleges for those who wish to pursue cross-disciplinary interests. One quarter of the studies, in the first three years, consist of individually tailored Advanced Studies specifically designed to provide you with a strong base in research. These courses may consist of a reading course with a world-leading scientist or a globally recognised expert on the Asia Pacific region, or joining a research team to get 'hands-on' experience.. In the fourth or Honours year of a PhB, you will undertake a research project for most of the year under the guidance of an academic supervisor. After completion of each 48 units towards the degree, the PhB Committee will determine whether the level of performance is sufficient to remain in the degree program. It is possible to transfer to another undergraduate degree program and receive credit for work successfully completed in the PhB. To remain enrolled in the PhB(Hons) degree, students must maintain an average mark of 80 percentÂ  each semester. To qualify for the degree the Honours year must be completed with first class honours. Two referee reports are used in the selection of students and must be submitted by November 30 in the year of application. Click here to access the forms.Â A quota can apply and interviews and school recommendations may also be used in the selection of students. You need to list the PhB (Hons) degree as a preference through the University Admissions Centre to be considered for admission.Â  Students who have completed one or two semesters of tertiary study in science or in Asia Pacific studies can apply for transfer into the PhB (Hons) degree. Career Options Employment Opportunities The PhB (Hons) is an ideal path to take if you are already aiming for a career in research, but it is equally good if you decide to enter the workforce directly, as you will not only have gained the academic and generic skills normally obtained within an undergraduate degree but will have gained highly marketable skills in independent research, oral and written communication and teamwork. Through the PhB (Hons), it is possible to specialise in areas as diverse as the science disciplines of astrophysics, bioinformatics, biomedical science, biotechnology, botany, chemistry, computer science, earth and environmental science, geography, geology, human sciences, life sciences, materials science, mathematical physics, mathematics, medical sciences, microbiology and parasitology, molecular biology, neuroscience, physics, psychology, software engineering, zoology. Students interested in Asia and the Pacific studies can focus on a wide range of areas including asia pacific security, asia pacific politics, Asian history, Asian languages, inter-asian cultural studies, northeast asian studies, pacific studies, peace, conflict & war, south asian studies, and southeast asian studies. Learning Outcomes Develop, apply, integrate and generate knowledge in educational and professional contexts: Develop and use a range of skills and methods to identify, analyse and respond to complex problems and issues; Identify and apply various research concepts, methodologies and methods Work and learn in both independent and collaborative ways with others to encompass diverse abilities and perspectives; Negotiate research projects considering their academic relevance, possible academic contributions, and ethical implications; Source and critically analyse research literature related to their topics of interest and research; Appraise concepts and arguments related to their topics of interest and research; Convey and relate professional and disciplinary information and ideas to diverse audiences in effective and appropriate ways; Develop high level project management skills as support for independent study; and Exercise personal, professional and social responsibility as a global citizen.

It is an integrated program leading to an Honours award. It is designed for intellectually ambitious students who aspire to study at the highest level. Every student receives intensive individual attention from an academic advisor. Â  The PhB is flexible in its structure with your program determined each year in collaboration with your academic advisor. One quarter of your studies in the first three years will consist of individually tailored advanced studies courses specifically designed to provide you with a strong base in research. In these courses, you might do a reading course or literature review with an academic. In the fourth year you will undertake an Honours year centred around one Arts discipline. Â  A strict quota will apply to enrolments in this degree program. A wide range of scholarships is available to potential applicants. Career Options Employment Opportunities The PhB is an ideal path to take if you are already aiming for a career in research, but it is equally good if you decide to enter the workforce directly, as you will not only have gained the academic and generic skills normally obtained within an arts degree but will have gained highly marketable skills in independent research, oral and written communication and also in teamwork. Learning Outcomes Successful completion of this program enables students to: Â  Â  identify various research concepts, methodologies and methods; Â  negotiate research projects by considering their academic relevance, possible academic contributions, and ethical implications; Â  source and critically analyse research literature related to their topics of interest and research, and Â  appraise concepts and arguments related to their topics of interest and research.

The degree offers concentrated study in psychology for students who want a thorough exploration of the discipline and the opportunity for specialisation in their third year before conducting a major research project in the Honours year. It includes courses in the major substantive areas of psychology, together with comprehensive training in the research design and data analysis techniques used in psychological science. Students are expected to maintain a high level of academic excellence in psychology courses. Note: this is a restricted entry program. Most students accepted into Honours psychology at ANU will continue to enter via other pathways such as BSc (Psych), BSc and BA. Career Options Employment Opportunities Psychology: Despite popular belief most psychology graduates work with people who are mentally healthy. Psychological graduates tend to find employment in three areas: as psychologists, in general graduate positions, and as psychological scientists (often in applied research settings). The main areas in which psychologists are employed include clinical, organisational, health, community, counselling and educational/developmental psychology. Psychology is an excellent preparation for broader graduate employment. Psychology graduates gain analytical, quantitative, report writing and communication skills that are focused on the issues and problems confronting human beings. Psychological science is an exciting career option with employment opportunities in the private and public sector as well as in universities and can involve designing interventions to solve human problems and researching how people function in different environments.

Do people see colours the same way? How do we make decisions? Contrary to popular belief most psychologists work with healthy people, trying to find the answers to questions like these. Studying psychology at ANU will expose you to a wide range of psychological sciences, covering topics as varied as how groups interact, vision and how it can be tricked to see what is not really there, how the brain develops as a baby and how it will change again as you get older, how impulses are carried from brain to muscle, and how things go wrong in abnormal psychology. The ANU Bachelor of Science (Psychology) teaches you skills sought after by employers including statistics and experimental design, critical thinking and communication, and provides an excellent grounding to enter the workforce or continue with further study. Career Options Employment Opportunities Despite popular belief, most psychology graduates work with people who are mentally healthy. Psychological graduates tend to find employment in three areas: as psychologists, in general graduate positions, and as psychological scientists (often in applied research settings). The three year degree is the launch pad for all of these career paths. The psychologist career path involves at least six years of training. The main areas in which psychologists are employed include clinical, organisational, health, community, counselling and educational/developmental psychology. The general graduate career path involves at least three years of training. Psychology is an excellent preparation for broader graduate employment. Psychology graduates gain analytical, quantitative, report writing and communication skills that are focused on the issues and problems confronting human beings. The psychological science career path involves four or more years of training. Psychological science is an exciting career option with employment opportunities in the private and public sector as well as in universities and can involve designing interventions to solve human problems and researching how people function in different environments.

Psychological graduates tend to find employment in three areas: as psychologists, in general graduate positions, and as psychological scientists (often in applied research settings). The three year degree is the launch pad for all of these career paths. The Graduate Diploma in Psychological Studies is the equivalent of the three year degree, in terms of serving as a pathway to the fourth year Honours program. The psychologist career path involves at least six years of training. The main areas in which psychologists are employed include clinical, organisational, health, community, counselling and educational/developmental psychology. The general graduate career path involves at least three years of training. Psychology is an excellent preparation for broader graduate employment. Psychology graduates gain analytical, quantitative, report writing and communication skills that are focused on the issues and problems confronting human beings. The psychological science career path involves four or more years of training. Psychology is an exciting career option with employment opportunities in the private and public sector as well as in universities and can involve designing interventions to solve human problems and researching how people function in different environments. Admission Requirements Prerequisites Australian Bachelor degree (or equivalent) in a cognate discipline area with an average of 60% in relevant later year courses including the completion of an accredited first year of Psychology Program Requirements Award Rules Degree Structure   Eight courses (48 units) in psychology.

Law electives are not studied in the first year and there is no requirement for newly-enrolling first-year students to specify the elective courses they intend to study in later years. By the time choice of electives is required, students are usually well informed of the factors which should guide their choices; in any case the Sub-Dean or Student Administration Manager are happy to assist those who need help in choosing electives.   Honours   This is a summary only.   The length of the program of study for the degrees of Juris Doctor and Juris Doctor with honours is the same.   The degree of Juris Doctor with honours shall consist of two parts:   Part A, which consists of a mark derived by applying the Honours scale to the eligible law courses undertaken by a student.  The mark for Part A shall constitute 70% of the final honours mark.   Part B, which consists of a mark derived by applying the Honours scale to the candidate's result in Honours Thesis.  The mark for Part B shall constitute 30% of the final honours mark.   A candidate shall not qualify for the degree with honours unless the candidate has completed 14 or more eligible law courses and Honours Thesis.

Career Options Employment Opportunities The forestry sector is both one of Australia's largest resource and manufacturing industries, and one of its most diverse. Foresters work from boardrooms to the bush, in conservation and production, and at scales from the paddock to the global. A career in forestry opens up a wide spectrum of opportunities around the world. Forestry is not just about understanding trees and forest ecosystems. It's about working with people, companies and governments to promote and sustain the diverse benefits forests represent. Professional foresters are central to addressing issues central to the future of our environment and regional economies: the management of native forests for conservation and sustainable production; the management of forested landscapes for environmental services; the development of new forms of forestry and forest industries to address land degradation in many parts of Australia, to restore landscapes and to help farmers enhance and diversify their incomes. Foresters may work in: State or territory forestry or national parks agencies - maintaining them for current and future generations, usually in partnership with local communities and indigenous Australians Government - developing policies, representing their State or Australia in national and international meetings, and engaging with stakeholders - locally, nationally, and globally Private forestry or resource companies - growing and processing forest products for environmentally friendly and sustainable economic development Community and conservation groups such as Greening Australia - advising farmers, land managers and others who need to grow and manage trees Universities and research organisations such as the CSIRO - finding new ways to grow, manage and use trees and forests for all their benefits Guiding corporations and investors - providing advice about assessing risks and managing opportunities International organisations such as the World Conservation Union, the World Bank and the Centre for International Forestry Research - working to meet the needs of communities around the world.

What is globalization and what are its implications? These are the two main questions addressed in this inter-disciplinary Master's Degree in Globalization. The program begins by addressing core concepts. After an intensive introductory course on the economic mechanics of globalization, students undertake a suite of tailored courses that look beyond simple business statistics to explore the cultural, political and social changes central to globalization. Throughout the first term students are constantly challenged to apply the lessons from the theoretical classes in a series of problem-based learning exercises and through assessed work that develops the ability to communicate complex information an ideas through the medium used in business, government and the NGO sector. In the second term students are free to choose from a wide range of the graduate course offerings at the ANU, tailoring the specific focus of the postgraduate degree to address the issues of interest to them, be it security, development, environmental sustainability or regional implications.   The program is ideally suited to individuals seeking an additional qualification to advance their career or those contemplating a career in academia. For those on the academic career path, the deep engagement with theory in the degree will provide a solid platform for further study. The focus in the first term on different forms of research communication will prove particularly useful for those seeking a career in an academic environment that is increasingly calling for research dissemination in formats other than the long essay. These same attributes will also serve students with a focus on professional career advancement well, with the added benefit of the clear development of a skill set that allows the rapid operationalization of theoretical insights and incisive analytical techniques.

This is often because of restricted educational opportunity, through geographic location; cultural or socio-economic expectations or restrictions; lack of choice, or poor choices; or personal factors such as individual or family circumstances which affect success. There are pathway options for students without the ATAR entry scores to study at ANU. However, even these programs can contain barriers to participation for some of the students ANU wishes to reach. There seems, therefore, to be a need for the University to supply an Enabling Program for students from equity groups who want to access ANU, but who lack the confidence, or the academic skills for study. The aim of the Program, then is to provide an Enabling Program for equity students to access ANU.   Admission Requirements Admission requires written recommendation from one of the following ANU officers: Principal and General Manager, ANU College Director, Tjabal Indigenous Higher Education Centre Director, Student Equity Recommendations will be based on one or more of the following Education Access Scheme criteria: Disrupted schooling Financial hardship Home or school environment English language difficulty Personal illness/disability Refugee status For further details, see www.uac.edu.au/eas Students who have not been awarded a year 12 certificate or equivalent must be 18 years old or older Program Requirements Award Rules The ANU Tertiary Preparatory Program requires the completion of 24 units, which must include:   18 units from completion of Academic Skills courses from the following list: PREP1001 Basic Numeracy (9 units) PREP1002 Basic Literacy (9 units) PREP1003 Knowledge and Culture (9 units)   6 units from completion of Academic Content courses from the following list PREP1004 Introduction to Philosophy (6 units) PREP1005 Introduction to Psychology (6 units) PREP1006 Big Ideas in Science (6 units) Study Options Year 1 Academic Skills course 1 eg PREP1002 9 units Academic Skills course 1 eg PREP1003 9 units Academic Content course eg PREP1006 6 units Scholarships ANU offers a wide range of scholarships to current and future students to assist with the cost of their studies.
